This form of entity lag uses minecarts pushed through the end portal and stacking in the middle of the obsidian platform. This allows for ease
of access and to load the minecarts all at once whenever a player loads the chunks in the end dimension. You can enhance this design
with any form of update twoards the stacked minecarts such as water. 

Notes:

- Easier and Faster to get the minecarts into position
- Could be easier to find if the server admin know what to look for. 
- Expensive
