Snowball Lag Machine Documentation

The snowball lagmachine uses snowballs sent from a entity stack of snow golems thrown at a stationary held zombie. The snowball entities
are captured via water and suspended to bounce. These entities by default will not despawn and continue building up as the snow golems
throw the snowballs. There are multiple designs, but the most common designs can be found in this repository. The design featured is very successful at stressing 
the server resources and bringing servers down to 1-2 tps. 

Noteable: 

- Like most entity lag methods plugins dedicated to clearing active entities can be problematic for this type of lag machine. 
- Depending on the version of minecraft you use, the process of placing golems can be significantly increased with a redstone machine. (most commonly a design by 0vip / zipdox)
- To ensure the life of the machine you should use a chunk loader. (make sure to build the machines in the same chunk, use f3 + g)
