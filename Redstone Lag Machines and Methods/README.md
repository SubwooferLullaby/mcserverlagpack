### Redstone Lag Machines

Why is redstone laggy?

Redstone is laggy due to how it updates, Not only does it update the light level around it (Redstone dust only) but it also counts as a blockstate update
A much more detailed look into how redstone is laggy can be found here https://github.com/SpaceWalkerRS/alternate-current/blob/main/README.md

In this folder you will find some litematica files for some template designs of lag machines.
