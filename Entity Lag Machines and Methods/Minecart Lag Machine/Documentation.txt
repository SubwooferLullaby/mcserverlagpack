Minecraft Lag Machine Documentation

The minecart lag machine uses minecarts spammed onto a rail system to pile entities together and lag the server. There are multiple variations
of the design to bypass various plugins aimed at stopping this method. The minecraft entity machine is very successful at stressing servers to 
1-4 tps depending on the amount of entities used. 

Noteable: 
- The area haboring the mass of the minecart entities must be chunk loaded.
