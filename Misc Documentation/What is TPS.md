What is TPS? 

TPS stands for ticks per second. The server will "tick" at a preferred rate of 20. The server can run lower but is preferred to stay in the
region on 15-20. Anything lower will cause rubber banding and lag. The server will tick once every .05 seconds, each tick a process is performed
such as entities moving or crops growing.
